    /// The `encodingMemoryThreshold` parameter allows Alamofire to automatically determine whether to encode in-memory
    /// or stream from disk. If the content length of the `MultipartFormData` is below the `encodingMemoryThreshold`,
    /// encoding takes place in-memory. If the content length exceeds the threshold, the data is streamed to disk
    /// during the encoding process. Then the result is uploaded as data or as a stream depending on which encoding
